# Cisco Service Provider Network Labs

## Overview
This repository is designed as a central resource for the engineers of the ASP Web Team to access, share, and collaborate on Cisco service provider network labs. The labs cover a range of advanced networking topics essential for designing, implementing, and troubleshooting service provider networks using Cisco technologies.

Github Repository: https://github.com/cisco-asp-web/asp-labs

## Objective
The primary goal of this repository is to enhance the technical skills of our team members in key areas of service provider networks, including BGP, MPLS, Segment Routing, IPv6, and network automation. By providing hands-on lab scenarios, we aim to ensure that our team can effectively handle real-world networking challenges faced in service provider environments.

## Lab Topics
- **BGP Configuration and Troubleshooting**: Learn to set up and manage BGP, including complex routing policies and troubleshooting techniques.
- **MPLS Fundamentals and Applications**: Explore the setup and application of MPLS technologies, including MPLS VPNs and traffic engineering.
- **Segment Routing**: Implement Segment Routing and explore how segments are encoded directly in the packet headers.
- **IPv6 Deployment**: Understand the strategies for IPv6 deployment and transition from IPv4 networks.
- **Network Automation**: Automate network operations using tools like Ansible, Python, and NETCONF/YANG.

## Getting Started
As of now, this repo is a collection of all the available labs developped for the ASP engineering team. 
The aim of this project is to automatically integrate these collections of labs into our dcloud environment or any containerlab instance you might want to use.

## Contributing
We encourage contributions to the lab scenarios. If you have a scenario that you believe would benefit the team, please follow these steps to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.

## Support
For support with any of the labs, please raise an issue in the repository or contact the repository maintainers.
